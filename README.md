<img src="./src/assets/images/ticket_tracker_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of application"/>

This is a web app that allows you to track the number of project tickets different employees within a company have completed. You can also increase or decrease the number for each employee if the situation changes. This was a paired programming task completed alongside two of my colleagues on the _nology bootcamp.
